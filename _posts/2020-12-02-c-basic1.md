The first thing you do learning a programming language is to print `Hello World`. It is a representative learning stage so ther is a [HelloWorld][Linkh] series for each programming language. The reason people first introduce and learn the `Hello World` output is because it's the simplest way to show that the code works fine.



```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void){
        printf("Hello World");  

        return 0;
    }
                
```


Looking at the code for displaying `Hello world`, `stdio.h` is declared with `#include` in the first line. A header file with the `.h` extension can be easily understood if you think of it as a source code file to use by writing a function in advance. The `printf` function is a standard library that exists in the `stdio.h` header file. Therefore, when using `printf`, always declare `stdio.h` file at the beginning.  
(Such as `stdio.h` file are automatically provided by the compiler every time)
